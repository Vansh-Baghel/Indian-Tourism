    "about": "The Andaman and Nicobar Islands located in the east of the Indian mainland geographically, float in splendid isolation in the Bay of Bengal. Once a hill range extending from Myanmar to Indonesia, these picturesque undulating islands, islets numbering around 572, are covered with dense rain-fed, damp and evergreen forests and endless varieties of exotic flora and fauna. Most of these islands (about 550) are in the Andaman Group, 28 of which are inhabited. The smaller Nicobars, comprise some 22 main islands (10 inhabited). The Andaman and Nicobars are separated by the Ten Degree Channel which is 150 Kms. wide.",
    "climate": "The islands have a tropical climate. The South-west Monsoon sets in Andaman Nicobar islands towards the end of May and the North-east Monsoon in November. There is no fury of hot summer, no chilling winter, no water clogging or traffic jams. For those who want to enjoy boating, swimming, snorkeling, sightseeing all 12 months is season. North Indians find relief from burning heat and chilling winter if they visit the island from May/June/July and in December/January. Season for nature lovers is May to December when forest is lush green and waterfalls are at their prime. Divers can enjoy the best during December to April and bird watchers during winter times.",
    "history": "The Andaman & Nicobar Islands have been inhabited for several thousand years, at the very least. The earlier archaeological evidence yet documented goes back some 2,200 years; however, the indications from genetic, cultural and linguistic isolation studies point to habitation going back 30,000 – 60,000 years, well into the Middle Palaeolithic. In the Andaman Islands, the various Andamanese people maintained their separated existence through the vast majority of this time, diversifying into distinct linguistic, cultural and territorial groups.",

The Mughal rule effectively ended in the 18th century, when the Maratha Empire conquered much of the subcontinent.\n\nMaratha rule was soon replaced by British rule in India. The British also made allies out of local rulers, who were allowed to rule their princely states. This period was marked by famines and economic exploitation. However, the British period also saw the growth of railways, telegraph and modern industry in the region. After Indian Independence in 1947, the various princely states of Rajasthan were integrated into India.",

The paintings themselves are inspired by the royal and romantic life of the Mughals. There are several styles of Rajasthani miniature paintings to choose from such as the Mewar, Bundi, Kota, Marwar, Bikaner, Jaipur and Kishangarh styles.

Blessed with an abundant bounty of building material, Rajasthani architects have gone on to construct some amazing structures including forts, temples and palaces which still stand strong today. When it came to construction, no stone was spared. From white marble to pink Dholpur stonr to green Kota stone, white and gray soapstone - everything was utilised to construct elegant statues, idols, figurines, carved panels and elaborate 'jharokas' for gardens and pavilions. The art of carving idols, figurines and utensils out of different types of stone is still in practice in Jaipur, Kota, Barmer, Ajmer and Dungarpur, and these places are worth a visit if you'd like to buy yourself a souvenir.",

This style of pottery is made from quartz and not clay. Materials that are used include quartz, raw glaze, sodium sulphate, and multani mitti (fuller's earth). The beautiful hues of blue and turquoise are obtained through the use of copper oxide and cobalt oxide which give it a distinctive look. Suitable for everyday use, the biggest advantage of blue pottery is that it does not develop cracks unlike regular earthen pots. Blue pottery is usually designed with Mughal era arabesque patterns, as well as animal and bird motifs. There are a number of products you can purchase including plates, flower vases, soap dishes, surahis (small pitchers), trays, coasters, fruit bowls, door knobs and glazed tiles with hand painted floral designs. The craft is mainly practiced in Jaipur and to a lesser extent in Sanganer, Mahalan, and Neota as well.",

Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari.[28] The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land.",
